<h1>Craig Crawler</h1>
<p>
Craig Crawler is intended to be a time saving tool. 
Rather than scouring the country looking for listings, I made
a bot do it for me.<br>
It began as a simple CLI tool, but at this stage I've looked into
moving into the browser.
</p>
<h1>Tech</h1>
<p>
Craig Crawl is built on the Python Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
My intent is to turn it into a fully functioning Flask application
using the aforementioned libraries.
</p>
<p>Run the command: FLASK_APP=main.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run
</p>

<p>Create selections on the frontend. Pass them through using ajax and
interpret them using the python from the link below</p>
